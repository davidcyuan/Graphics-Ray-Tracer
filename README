Ray Specs:
  Almost all rays created from intersection points are brought backwards by RAY_EPSILON
  Shadowrays for shadow attenuation are instead brought forward by RAY_EPSILON, so as to not add the same intersection point multiple times
  Shadowrays for shadow attenuation use twice the magnitude of RAY_EPSILON, as there are certain edge cases where not doing so leads to errors
    Specifically, the hypothesis is that rays will sometimes clip the boundary of two connected surfaces, and by computational imprecision, not collide with either,
    leading to edge cases. Fixing this feels like outside the scope of the project, as it requires editing intersection detection for all objects, most of which are
    pre-implemented should be expected to work.
